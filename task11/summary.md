## Summary

Summary:

A 25-year-old male student working part-time as a postman presented with a sharp chest pain lasting a few seconds, occurring over the past three days. The pain is localized over the heart, sometimes radiating to the neck, worsens with coughing and lying down, and improves when leaning forward. He rates the pain as 6/10 in severity. There are no associated symptoms such as shortness of breath, dizziness, palpitations, weakness, numbness, fever, or viral symptoms currently, although he recently recovered from the flu. He has no significant past medical history, no medications except occasional Tylenol (which has helped the pain), no allergies, no surgeries, and denies smoking or recreational drug use; he drinks alcohol occasionally.  

His main concern stems from a recent family history: his father suffered a fatal heart attack two weeks ago, heightening his anxiety about his own symptoms. The clinician acknowledged the patient's fear and plans to perform diagnostic tests, including an ECG and possibly blood work, to assess heart function and rule out serious cardiac problems. The patient lives with his mother and is studying engineering. The clinician advised the patient to avoid excessive worry while awaiting test results and provided emotional support throughout the encounter.
